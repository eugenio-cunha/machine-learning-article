  Nowadays, there is an intense amount of essays being produced and evaluated 
  in entrance exams, competitions and exams. Unlike the manuals, which process 
  and evaluate the essays manually, this work addresses an automatic way, 
  through machine learning, capable of generalizing, learning and extracting 
  standards from writing based on the labeled content. The method needs little 
  human intervention and allows the valuation of large amounts of texts. This 
  job is based on the problem of manual assessment of competences required in a 
  essay-argumentative writing text with diverse themes social, scientific, 
  cultural or political. Given a corpus of the main objective is to induce a 
  model to classify the required by writing an evaluation note on the text. 
  Embasado in the main metrics of analysis of the classifiers cited in the 
  literature of machine learning, the solution proposed in this work was shown 
  to be useful and useful for use in issues involving text valuation manual by 
  trained professionals.
